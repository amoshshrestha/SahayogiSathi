                  Established in January 2021 to address the economic hardships
                  faced by families during the post-COVID era. Many parents lost
                  their jobs, leaving them unable to afford their children's
                  education. We believe that no child should be deprived of
                  schooling due to financial constraints, and this vision drives
                  our work.

                  While based in Kathmandu, our efforts began in
                  Sindhupalchowkâ€”a region deeply impacted by the 2016 earthquake
                  and recurrent natural disasters like landslides and floods.
                  Recognizing the urgent need for support in this area, we
                  focused our initial projects there, including sponsoring
                  children's education, distributing clothing and books, and
                  providing flood relief. Today, we have expanded our efforts to
                  other regions in Nepal, aiming to make a broader impact.

              Our work is centered on empowering children by addressing their
              educational, health, and developmental needs. This includes
              covering school tuition, providing essential resources like books
              and clothing, conducting menstrual hygiene workshops, and
              mentoring high school students through college applications. We
              also aim to support younger children by providing foundational
              resources to help them succeed in the long term.
